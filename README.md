## 📦 E-Commerce Shipping Optimization

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project focuses on identifying factors contributing to late deliveries and forecasting shipping/freight costs using predictive modeling techniques. By leveraging ~11,000 shipment records, we explore key drivers behind delivery performance and build models that support logistics optimization and operational efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview

Timely delivery is critical to customer satisfaction in e-commerce. Our objectives include:
1. Predict whether a shipment will arrive on time.
2. See what featuress caus these delays.
3. Make business decisions and adjustments to prevent delays.

We perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and develop machine learning models to uncover actionable insights.
