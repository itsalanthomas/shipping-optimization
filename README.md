## 📦 E-Commerce Shipping Optimization

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project focuses on identifying factors contributing to late deliveries and forecasting shipping/freight costs using predictive modeling techniques. By leveraging ~11,000 shipment records, we explore key drivers behind delivery performance and build models that support logistics optimization and operational efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview

Timely delivery is critical to customer satisfaction in e-commerce. Our objective is twofold:
1. Predict whether a shipment will arrive on time.
2. Estimate the cost of shipping based on product features.

We perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development to uncover actionable insights.
